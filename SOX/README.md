## Approach

- Design and document SOX-relevant controls **now** for Shop Dollars (Shop User Stored Value), Merchant User Stored Value (merchant wallet and payouts), and related FBO/cash and MSB Call Report processes.
- Emphasise **third-party reconciliations** (bank, payment processor, payment partner) where possible for stronger evidence.
- Align with **Financial Reporting Policy** (Board update, restatement escalation) and **MSB Call Reports** in this repo.
