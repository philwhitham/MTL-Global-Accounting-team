# Policy Statements

## Governance of Reporting Functions

The Company shall maintain documented procedures for the preparation, review, and submission of all reports falling within the Reporting Functions. Such procedures shall include data collection, validation, internal review, and submission by applicable deadlines (e.g., 45 days after quarter-end for MSB Call Reports).

## Annual Board Update on Financial Reports Filed

**The Board shall be provided an update on financial reports filed no less than annually.**

Such update shall include, at a minimum:

- A list of reports filed during the period (e.g., MSB Call Reports by quarter);
- The reporting periods covered and submission dates;
- A summary of any material issues, restatements, or errors addressed during the period;
- Confirmation that submissions were made in accordance with this policy and applicable deadlines.

The timing and format of the annual update shall be coordinated with the Board’s meeting calendar and may be delivered as part of a broader compliance or financial reporting presentation.

## Escalation of Restatements, Material Errors, and Other Material Matters

**Any Reporting Function submission that includes (i) a material restatement of prior reporting, (ii) disclosure of a material error, or (iii) any other matters pertaining to the Reporting Functions that an individual granted access to the NMLS system reasonably believes may be material to the Company shall be escalated to a Board member prior to submission, to the extent practicable.**

- **Prior to submission:** Escalation should occur before the relevant report is submitted to NMLS or another regulatory authority, so that the Board member has an opportunity to be informed.
- **To the extent practicable:** Where timing or circumstances make prior notification impracticable (e.g., imminent regulatory deadline, unavailability of a Board member), the Company shall escalate as soon as practicable after submission and document the reasons for any delay.
- **Documentation:** All such escalations and, where applicable, the Board member’s acknowledgment or response shall be documented and retained in accordance with Documentation and Retention below.
