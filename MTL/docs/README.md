# MTL Policy and Reference Documents

Policy materials for **MTL (Money Transmitter License) governance** are maintained with the rest of the project documentation in **`docs/`**.

## Financial Reporting Policy (in `docs/`)

| Document | Location | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Path forward** | **`docs/PATH_FORWARD_FINANCIAL_REPORTING_POLICY.md`** | Suggested approach, steps, timeline, and open points for Legal. |
| **Draft policy** | **`docs/Financial_Reporting_Policy_DRAFT.md`** | Full draft (purpose, scope, Board update, restatement escalation, roles, procedures). |

Reference materials (official policy template, Vendor Management, AML, IT Security) should be placed in **`docs/`** when available so the draft can be aligned to the same structure.
